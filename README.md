# Collaborative Shopping List App with Firebase

ShoppyList is a collaborative shopping list app built with Flutter and Firebase. It allows users to create or join shared lists, add or remove items in real time, and instantly see updatesâ€”powered by cloud-based synchronization.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Initial Setup

1. Change App Name
- Update the app name by modifying the AndroidManifest.xml file located at:
    ```
    android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
    ```

- Set the label attribute inside the <application> tag:
    ```
    android:label="ShoppyList"
    ```

2. Add App Icon
- Add Dependency
    In your pubspec.yaml, under dev_dependencies, add:
    ```
    flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.4
    ```

- Configure Icon Path
    Also in pubspec.yaml, add the following configuration:
    ```
    flutter_launcher_icons:
        android: true
        ios: false
        image_path: assets/images/app_icon.png


    flutter:
        uses-material-design: true

        assets:
            - assets/images/app_icon.png
    ```
    ðŸ’¡ Make sure the icon file app_icon.png exists at assets/images/.

- Generate Icons
    ```
    flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
    or
    dart run flutter_launcher_icons
    ```
    This will generate platform-specific app icons.
